# erlang-in-anger-notes

A record of my notes as I go through the [Erlang In Anger](https://www.erlang-in-anger.com/) textbook. Well, more precisely I'll be recording my answers to the exercises attached at the end of each chapter.

I adapted the structure from [greentfrapp's Deep Learning Book Notes](https://github.com/greentfrapp/deep-learning-book-notes).

Context: Playing around with Elixir and Erlang for abit.
Hoping that some of the learnings will carry over to any Elixir Projects I undertake but we'll see.
